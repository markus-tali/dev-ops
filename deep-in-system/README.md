## 1. The Virtual Machine Part

### Installing Ubuntu Server as a Virtual Machine

#### Setting hostname as {username}-host:

- Created a script file to set the hostname:
  sudo nano /usr/local/bin/set_hostname.sh

- Added the following script:

```bash
  USERNAME=$(whoami)

  NEW_HOSTNAME="${USERNAME}-host"

  sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "$NEW_HOSTNAME"

  echo "$NEW_HOSTNAME" | sudo tee /etc/hostname > /dev/null

  sudo sed -i "s/127.0.1.1 .\*/127.0.1.1 $NEW_HOSTNAME/" /etc/hosts
```

- Made the script executable:

```bash
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/set_hostname.sh
```

- Added the script to `/etc/profile` to run at each login:

```bash
  sudo nano /etc/profile
```

---

## 2. The Network Part

### Setting a Private IP Address with Netmask:

- Created a Netplan file:

```bash
  sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
```

- Added the configuration:

```yaml
  network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
  enp0s3:
  dhcp4: no
  addresses: - 192.168.75.200/23 # The IP address of the server
  routes: - to: default
  via: 192.168.75.1 # IP address of the router found with `ip route | grep default`
  nameservers:
  addresses: - 8.8.8.8 # Google DNS
```

- Changed permissions for security:

```bash
  sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
```

- Applied changes:

```bash
  sudo netplan apply
```

## 3. The Security Part

### SSH Configuration:

- Installed SSH server:

```bash
  sudo apt install openssh-server -y
```

- Edited SSH configuration:

```bash
  sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

- Updated settings:
  PermitRootLogin no
  Port 2222

- Applied changes:

```bash
  sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Configuring Firewall:

- Installed and enabled UFW:

```bash
  sudo apt install ufw
  sudo ufw default deny incoming
  sudo ufw default allow outgoing
  sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp
  sudo ufw enable
```

---

## 4. User Management Part

### Adding Users:

1. **luffy (Public Key Authentication, Sudoer):**

```bash
   sudo adduser luffy
   sudo usermod -aG sudo luffy
   sudo mkdir /home/luffy/.ssh
   sudo nano /home/luffy/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

- Pasted the public key into `authorized_keys`.

```bash
  sudo chmod 600 /home/luffy/.ssh/authorized_keys
  sudo chown -R luffy:luffy /home/luffy/.ssh
```

2. **zoro (Password Authentication, Non-Sudoer):**

```bash
sudo adduser zoro
```

---

## 5. Services Part

### Installing FTP Server:

- Installed `vsftpd`:

```bash
  sudo apt install vsftpd -y
```

- Edited the configuration:

```bash
  sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
```

- Enabled the following:
  local_enable=YES
  write_enable=NO
  chroot_local_user=YES

- Created the `nami` user:

```bash
  sudo adduser nami
  sudo usermod -d /backup nami
```

- Restricted `nami` to `/backup`:

```bash
  sudo chown -R root:nami /backup
  sudo chmod 750 /backup
```

---

## 6. The Database Part

### MySQL Configuration:

- Installed MySQL:

```bash
  sudo apt install mysql-server -y
```

- Disabled remote root login by updating `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`:
  bind-address = 127.0.0.1

### WordPress Database Setup:

- Accessed MySQL:

```bash
  sudo mysql -u root
```

- Created WordPress database and user:

```sql
  CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
  CREATE USER 'wpuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '1234';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.\* TO 'wpuser'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

DB NAME = 'wordpress'
DB USER = 'wpuser'
DB PASSWORD = '1234'
DB HOST = 'localhost'

---

## 7. WordPress Part

### WordPress Installation:

- Downloaded WordPress:

```bash
  wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
  tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
  sudo mv wordpress /var/www/html
```

- Set permissions:

```bash
  sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress
  sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/wordpress
```

- Secured `wp-config.php`:

```bash
  sudo mv /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
  sudo chmod 600 /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
```

---

## 8. Backup Part

### Configuring Cron Job:

- Created backup script:

```bash
  sudo nano /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
```

Script content:

```yaml
#!/bin/bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d)
BACKUP_FILE="/backup/wp-database-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"
mysqldump -u wpuser -p'1234' wordpress > /tmp/wp-database.sql
tar -czvf $BACKUP_FILE /tmp/wp-database.sql
echo "Backup completed at $(date)" >> /var/log/backup.log
```

- Made the script executable:

```bash
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
```

- Scheduled cron job:

```bash
  crontab -e
```

Cron entry:

```bash
0 0 \* \* \* /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
```

## 9. Q&a

### What is sudo group in Linux?

- The sudo group in Linux allows its members to run commands with root (admin) privileges using sudo. Users in this group can perform system tasks without logging in as root.

### What is a netmask?

- A netmask is a number that defines which part of an IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to devices (hosts).

### Why is a static IP address important for a web server?

- A static IP keeps a web server's address constant, ensuring stable access, reliable domain mapping, and easier security setup. Without it, connections may break.

### What is an ssh server and what is the role of it?

- An SSH server allows secure remote access to a computer over a network. It lets users log in, run commands, and transfer files safely using encryption. It's mainly used for server management without needing physical access.

### What is a firewall and what is the role of it in a server?

- A firewall is a security system that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic on a server. It blocks unauthorized access while allowing safe connections, protecting the server from attacks.

### What is an FTP server and what is the role of it?

- An FTP server is a system that allows users to upload, download, and manage files over a network. Itâ€™s used for file sharing and storage, making it easy to transfer data between computers.

### What is a cron job and what is the role of it?

- A cron job is a scheduled task in Linux that runs automatically at set times. It's used for automation, like backups, updates, and system maintenance, without manual intervention.

### Why are backups important?

- Backups protect data from loss due to mistakes, hardware failures, or cyberattacks. They ensure you can restore important files and keep systems running smoothly.
