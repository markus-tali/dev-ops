# DEEP-IN-NET

**You need to instal Cisco Packet Tracer to audit this exercise. You can install it from [here](https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer).**

Here are all the answers to the questions in the audit page with pictures.

1. What is an RJ-45 cable?

An RJ-45 cable is a network cable used to connect devices like computers, routers, and switches. It has an 8-pin connector and is commonly used for Ethernet connections.

2. Difference between straight-through and crossover RJ-45 cables:

Straight-through cable: The wires on both ends are in the same order. It connects **different** devices, like a computer to a router.
Crossover cable: The wires on one end are rearranged to cross over. It connects **similar** devices, like one computer to another.

### **1. The function of a switch and a hub, how they operate and their role in networking:**

**Switch:**

- Connects multiple devices in a network.
- Sends data only to the specific device (port) it is meant for.
- Learns device MAC addresses to make intelligent decisions.
- Uses MAC addresses to direct data to the correct port.
- Efficient and reduces network congestion.

**Hub:**

- Connects multiple devices in a network.
- Broadcasts data to all devices, whether they need it or not.
- Does not know where specific devices are.
- Sends data to every connected device.
- Less efficient and causes network traffic.

### **2. Differences Between Switch and Hub:**

| Feature           | Switch                          | Hub                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Data Transfer** | Directs data to specific device | Broadcasts data to all devices |
| **Efficiency**    | High                            | Low                            |
| **Traffic**       | Reduces unnecessary traffic     | Creates more traffic           |
| **Cost**          | More expensive                  | Cheaper                        |
| **Modern Use**    | Commonly used                   | Rarely used                    |

### **3. OSI Model Layer:**

1. **Switch:**

   - Operates on **Layer 2** (Data Link Layer) because it uses MAC addresses.
   - Some advanced switches can also work on **Layer 3** (Network Layer).

2. **Hub:**
   - Operates on **Layer 1** (Physical Layer) as it does not process or understand data.
